# Winding a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Up (Summary)

## 1. Reasons for Winding Up an SMSF
- **Cost considerations**: High fixed costs may make an SMSF no longer viable, and switching to an alternative super fund may be more cost-effective.
- **Trustees moving overseas**: SMSFs may no longer comply with regulations if trustees move overseas.
- **Ceasing membership**: Membership changes due to death, divorce, or disagreements may necessitate winding up the SMSF.
- **Administrative burden**: Trustees may no longer want to manage the administrative tasks involved in maintaining an SMSF.
- **Trustee disqualification**: Trustees becoming disqualified persons due to legal issues or bankruptcy must wind up the fund.

## 2. Legal and Accounting Assistance
- **Role of legal advisers**: Help interpret the trust deed to ensure the winding up complies with regulations.
- **Role of accountants**: Ensure income and liabilities are correctly identified, benefits are paid or transferred appropriately, and remaining funds are used to pay expenses.

## 3. Factors to Consider Before Winding Up
- **Capital gains tax (CGT)**: Selling or transferring assets may trigger CGT events.
- **Reserves**: Any reserves must be allocated to members' accounts before benefits are transferred.
- **Life insurance**: Policies held by the SMSF must be transferred or replaced before winding up.
- **Outstanding returns**: All outstanding tax returns must be lodged before winding up.
- **Frozen assets**: If the SMSF holds frozen assets, these may prevent winding up the fund.

## 4. Steps in Winding Up an SMSF
- **Check the trust deed**: Review the fund's trust deed for specific rules on winding up.
- **Hold a trustee meeting**: Trustees must formally resolve to wind up the fund, documented in writing.
- **Dispose of assets**: Trustees need to value and sell or transfer fund assets based on member preferences.
- **Prepare draft financial statements**: Interim financial statements are needed to value members' benefits and account for wind-up costs.
- **Pay out or rollover benefits**: After assets are sold or transferred, members' benefits are paid out or rolled over into another fund.
- **Final audit**: A final audit is required before submitting the final SMSF annual return.
- **Lodge final return**: Submit the final tax return and ensure all tax liabilities are paid.
- **Close the bank account**: Once liabilities are paid, the fund's bank account can be closed.

## 5. Record Keeping After Winding Up

  - **Five years**: Accounting records, annual returns, and other ATO filings.
  - **Ten years**: Trustee meeting minutes, trustee declarations, consent to act as trustee, and trust deeds.

## 6. Final Steps
